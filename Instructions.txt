As a team, discuss what you want your final project to be. 
Write documentation for the enpoints you will have in your API.
Make sure the documentation is clear and thorough so that you can use it as a checklist when you start coding your project.
There must be at least 1 full CRUD endpoint for each team member.
One team member should create a GitHub repository where the final project will eventually go.
Push the documentation to the repository. Each team member must write the documentation for the endpoints they will be working on.
Each team member must push their documentation to the repository so that the instructor can see each individaul's contribution.
Even though each member pushes their own documentation, it must be organized and in a standard format.
